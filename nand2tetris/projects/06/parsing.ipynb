This must be done with a Python script called `hasm.py` (hack assembler) that can accept a command line argument that specifies the assembly file (`.asm`) that you want to covert to binary code (`.hack`). The following code opens a file specified by a command line argument an reads it line by line. Specific features in this code include:\n","\n","* The `sys.argv` is a list containing each term that was typed at the command line. Individual list entries were separated by spaces at the command line.\n","* There is error checking to see that only one source (`.asm`) file is specified by checking that the command line argument was `hasm.py filename` and that the filename exists and can be opened. \n","* The `with` keyword in python is used, along with `try` and `except` to do error handling.\n","* control is turned over to a function, `Pass1`, where the actual processing will take place. Later, this function should probably be moved to another file for clarity.\n","* The `Pass1` function has been equipped with some basic comment processing and white space handling as follows:\n","*`find('//')` is used to get the location of the comment string `//`. Python indexing is then used to eliminate parts of a line that follow the comment string.\n","*`strip()` is used to remove all white space from the resulting line."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"fb_paAwTpeeb","outputId":"684d5b1c-9aaf-4a19-b1c9-1a20fb706c09"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["testing\n","testline2\n","testline3\n"]}],"source":["test = []\n","test.append(\"testing\")\n","test.append(\"testline2\")\n","test.append(\"testline3\")\n","\n","\n","for line in test:\n","    print(line)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VEcrY-4_peeb"},"source":["### Dictionaries\n","The main construct for managing translation of assembly to binary will be the dictionary, or symbol table.
